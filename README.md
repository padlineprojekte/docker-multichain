# docker-multichain

This is the repository for the padlineprojekte/multichain-* docker images.

It is a fork of [itteratec's repository](https://github.com/iteratec/docker-multichain).

Basically we updated the MultiChain binaries to latest v2 as of 2020-05-19. And we are 
using Enterprise version of MultiChain.

## Images

* [iteratec/multichain-base](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/iteratec/multichain-base): 
    A base Ubuntu with the latest Multichain deamon installed.
* [iteratec/multichain-master](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/iteratec/multichain-master): 
    Based on the "base" image running a master node, creates a blockchain and runs it. 
    *Important: only for development if started with default parameters since any node can 
    connect, anyone can administer and the RPC interface is open to all.*
* [iteratec/multichain-node](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/iteratec/multichain-node): 
    Based on the same "base" image and connects to the master node.
* [iteratec/multichain-explorer](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/iteratec/multichain-explorer): 
    A node with the [multichain-explorer](https://github.com/MultiChain/multichain-explorer) installed.

## Running the cluster

Use this [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/Kunstmaan/docker-multichain/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) and run:

```
sudo docker-compose up
```


## Persisting your chain

Add a volume

\<somewhere\>:/root/.multichain

## Configuration

### Masternode

To configure your chain, we use environment variables.

#### Required

* CHAINNAME: DockerChain
* NETWORK_PORT: 7447       # also expose this port!
* RPC_PORT: 8000           # also expose this port!
* RPC_USER: multichainrpc
* RPC_PASSWORD: 79pgKQusiH3VDVpyzsM6e3kRz6gWNctAwgJvymG3iiuz
* RPC_ALLOW_IP: 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0

`RPC_ALLOW_IP` may contain multiple ip addresses/masks/cidr's, separated by a comma. Setting a single ip
works like this: 

    # will allow RPC from 23.24.25.26 only:
    -e RPC_ALLOW_IP=23.24.25.26 
    
While setting up multiple ip addresses could be done like this:

    # will allow RPC from 23.24.25.26, from 172.16.0.0/12 and from 34.35.36.37/255.255.255.0:
    -e RPC_ALLOW_IP=23.24.25.26,172.16.0.0/12,34.35.36.37/255.255.255.0  

#### Optional

* PARAM_<something descriptive>='<variable>|<value>' e.g: `PARAM_TARGET_BLOCK_SIZE='target-block-time|15'`

These variables can be set:

### Slavenode

To configure your chain, we use environment variables.

#### Required

* CHAINNAME: DockerChain
* NETWORK_PORT: 7447       # also expose this port!
* RPC_PORT: 8000           # also expose this port!
* RPC_USER: multichainrpc
* RPC_PASSWORD: 79pgKQusiH3VDVpyzsM6e3kRz6gWNctAwgJvymG3iiuz
* RPC_ALLOW_IP: 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0
* MASTER_NODE: masternode   # IP address of the master node, or a docker compose link. Don't forget the links section!

`RPC_ALLOW_IP` may contain multiple ip addresses/masks/cidr's, separated by a comma. Setting a single ip
works like this: 

    # will allow RPC from 23.24.25.26 only:
    -e RPC_ALLOW_IP=23.24.25.26 
    
While setting up multiple ip addresses could be done like this:

    # will allow RPC from 23.24.25.26, from 172.16.0.0/12 and from 34.35.36.37/255.255.255.0:
    -e RPC_ALLOW_IP=23.24.25.26,172.16.0.0/12,34.35.36.37/255.255.255.0

### Releasing

Releases are done with automated builds in Docker-Hub. 
Releasing a new version of a docker image is triggered by pushing git-tags into the repository.
The 4 different images can be released seperately.
The git-tags need to match one of the following schemes:

git tag -a base-release-v1.0.0 -m "release v1.0.0 of base-image"
git tag -a base-release-demo-v1.0.0 -m "release v1.0.0 of base-image with MultiChain-demo version"
git tag -a node-release-v1.0.0 -m "release v1.0.0 of node-image"
git tag -a master-release-v1.0.0 -m "release v1.0.0 of master-image"
git tag -a explorer-release-v1.0.0 -m "release v1.0.0 of explorer-image"
"v1.0.0" gives the version number of the image.

Pushing the git-tag triggers the building of a new image
e.g. git push origin base-release-v1.0.0
